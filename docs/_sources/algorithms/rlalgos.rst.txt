Provided Algorithms
===================

We provide multiple RL algorithms as examples.
1) A2C with General Advantage Estimator
2) PPO with discrete actions
3) Duelling Q-Learning
4) SAC for continuous actions

The algorithms can be used as example to implement your own algorithms. Each algorithm is parametrized by a `YAML` file that contains the parameters (based on the `hydra` framework).

Typical execution is : `python main.py -cd script_directory -cn config.yaml`

Note that all algorithms produced a tensorboard and a CSV output.\
