# Now, one can use a wrapper to transform this gym.Env to a rlstructures.VecEnv
# 1. A VecEnv corresponds to env.n_envs() environnements that are running simultaneously
# 2. VecEnv receives a dictTensor d as action where d.n_elems()<=env.n_envs()
# 3. VecEnv returns a DictTensor obs as an observation. This observation contains multiple "field". 
# e.g obs["reward"] is the reward signal, obs["initial_state"] tells if it is the first state of a new episode, ...
# Actually, since N <= env.n_envs() environments are still running at timestep t, the VecEnv.reset()  and VecEnv.step(...) methods also returns the list of envs that are still running
#
# Example: (obs,who_was_running),(obs2,who_is_still_running) = env.step(action)
# * obs is the observation (at t) coming from the environments that were running at t-1
# * who_was_running is the list of environnments still running at time t-1. Note that who_was_running.size()[0]=obs.n_elems()
# * obs2 is the observation (at t) from the environments that are still running at time t (i.e obs2 is a subset of obs)
# * who_is_still_running is the list of environments running at time t

# Note that gym wrappers work with continuous and discrete action spaces, but may not with environments where the action space is more complicated.
# If you are facing gym envs with a complex action space, you may develop your own wrapper
# A good starting point is the rlstructures.GymEnv code which is very simple can be used to define a new wrapper
# All the other rlstuctures components will work with complex action spaces without modifications

# Trajectories in RLStructures

# When acquiring trajectories throug the *batcher.get* execution, one receives a **TemporalDictTensor**
# * Each element of the trajectories (at time t) is a complete transition

# To illustrate the structure let us consider an example:
# * We assume that the environment returns a {"frame":..., "reward":....} observation (as a DictTensor)
# * We assume that an agent_state is {"agent_timestep":...,"state":...}
# * We assume that the action returned by the agent is {"action":...,"action_probabilities":....}

# In that case:
# * *trajectories["frame"]* contains the values "frame" at each timestep t
# * *trajectories["action"]* contains the action taken by the agent at each timestep t
# * *trajectories["action_probabilities"]* contains the action taken by the agent at each timestep t
# * * Note that *"action_probabilities"* may not be used by the environment, but since it is outputed by the agent, it will be accessible in the trajectory
# * *trajectories.mask()* returns a 0/1 matrix telling if one element is 'valid or not'. We have *trajectories.mask().sum(1)==trajectories.lengths*
# * The '_' prefix corresponds to the agent state and environment information at *t+1*:
# * * trajectories["_frame"] is the observation at *t+1*
# * * trajectories["_action"] **does not exist** since *action* is not part of the agent state (it is part of the action)
# * * trajectories["_agent_timestep"] is the state of the agent at *t+1*
# * * trajectories["_reward"] is the value of 'reward' retruned by the environment at *t+1* (which corresponds to what is usually denoted $r_t$ i.e the reward recevied after action $a_t$)
